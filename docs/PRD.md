### 3.4 About Page Content Template

**Key messaging to incorporate:**
```
"In my Lake Stevens studio I produce about 50–70 pieces per month. Each mug, bowl, and plate is hand-thrown, glazed, and fired one by one, ensuring each is truly unique. Working in small batches lets me focus on form and finish while keeping my work personal and intentional.

I fire my kiln about once a month, producing a limited collection of work each time. What you see here is what's fresh from the latest firing.

Most months I throw and glaze about 50 pieces, which I list here as they come out of the kiln. Each month I complete one or two kiln loads of work, about 60–80 finished pieces."
```

**Visual elements:**
- [ ] Photo of freshly-loaded kiln full of work
- [ ] Caption: "This month's kiln: 42 mugs, 15 bowls, 6 vases. Each one now ready to find a home."
- [ ] Gallery of "This month's collection" that refreshes monthly
